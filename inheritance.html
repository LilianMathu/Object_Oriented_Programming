<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p>
    Inheritance refers to classes deriving functionalities from other classes. In inheritance, 
    there an <b>abstact class</b> which contains all the common methods and properties. 
    To inherit the common properties and methods, the extends keyword is used.
    <br>
    The inherited object contains all properties from its parent object. 
    In addition, it will also specify its own set of unique properties.
</p>



<br>
<h4>Extending a class</h4>
A class is extended using the extends keyword. Since classes are objects, 
every base class is an instance of the object prototype as shown by the method <b>instanceof</b>. 

<p>

</p>




<br>
<h4>Inheriting constructors</h4>
<p>
        super() which calls the constructor of the parent class. super()operator is actually the parent class constructor, passing it the necessary arguments of the Parent 
        class constructor will also initialize the parent class properties in our sub-class, 
        thereby inheriting it: <br>
       <pre><code>
                class Teacher extends Person {
                    constructor(first, last, age, gender, interests, subject, grade) {
                      super(first, last, age, gender, interests);
                  
                      // subject and grade are specific to Teacher
                      this.subject = subject;
                      this.grade = grade;
                    }
                  }
        </code></pre> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NB</b>Super() must be included even if the abstract class does not have anything. 
        It is included before the specifoc properties are added, that is, 
        immediately after the declaration of the constructor.
    </p>
<p>
    You can pass arguments to a constructor as shown in the code snippet above.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Inheriting properties</h4>
<p>
    Inherited properties are included after the super keyword in the constructor's body. 
    Extended classes can change the properties of the base class by defining new values for the properties.
