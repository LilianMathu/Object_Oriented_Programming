    <h3>Concepts of object oriented programming</h3>
    <h4>Modules</h4>
    <p>
        A module has its own namespace at the module level. They do not pollute the global space.
    </p>



    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>A class is a blueprint. Classes are created using the class keyword followed 
        by a className whose first letter is capitalized.
    </p>
    <p>In ES6, a class is a type of a function.</p>
    <p>The output of #console.log(typeOf className)# will give you a function. </p>
    <p>In ES5, there were no classes. Classes in ES6 acts like constructor functions in ES6.</p>




    <h4>Constructors</h4>
    <p>To initialize information for a class instance (object) we do it in a constructor using the 
       constructor keyword. Arguments in a constructor are used to initiate objects.
       You can pass arguments to the constructor like shown below:
       <br>
       Class Drone{
        constructor(id, Name){
            console.log(id +" " +name);
        }
       }
       let drone = new Drone(1234 "Cool Drone");
    </p>
    <p>
       Best practice is to reduce the operations in a constructor, only include the instance variables.
       Instance variables are created in the constructor function in the class. The <b>this</b> keyword is used
    to refer to the instance being created.
    </p>





    <h4>Objects</h4>
    <p>
        An onject is an instance of a class.
        To create an object, the new keyword is used.<br>
        let drone = new Drone.<br>
        if you log out typeof drone, which is the name of the new object, the result is an object.
    
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        After instanciating the variables with the this keyword in the constructor function, you can access
        them using the dot notation or the bracket notation. In bracket notation <b>properties are accessed as strings.</b>
   <br>
    <p>
        console.log("drone: " +drone.id +" " +drone.name);         //dot notation.
        <br>
        console.log("drone: " +drone['id'] +" " +drone['name']);   //bracket notation.

    </p>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h4>Instance variables (Properties) and Statis (class) properties</h4>
    <p>
        Instance variables are properties of a specific instance of the variable. Consider the code below  <br>
        <br>
        <b>
    
        let drone = new Drone(1234, "cool drone");
        <br><br>
        let drone1 = new Drone(4567, "awesome drone");
         </b>

    </p>
    <p>
        The values of drone and drone1 are instance variables. Each instance will have different 
        instance variables.

    </p>
    <p>
        However, we can have properties that are common to all drones, in addition to their instance properties.
        These properties are referred to as the class or static properties.
        <br>
        Static properties are added after the closing class bracket.
    </p>
    <br>






    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <p>
        In addition to having properties on classes, we can also add methods. 
        A <b>method</b> is a function that gets attached to the instance.
        <br><br>
        <b>
        fly(){                                                     <br>
            console.log("Drone: " +this.id +" " +"is flying");         <br>
        }                                                            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            ->fly is a method attached to each instance.
        </b>
        After creating the methods in the class body, you need to call them in an instance.
        <br>

      <b>fly.drone();</b> 
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>NB: It is important to note that properties of an instance are accessed using the this keyword.</b>





    <h4>Static methods</h4>
    <p>
        The <b>static</b> keyword defines a static method for a class. 
        Static methods aren't called on instances of the class. 
        Instead, they're called on the class itself. These are often utility functions, 
        such as functions to create or clone objects.   
        <br>
        <br>
        class Drone{                                  <br>
            static getCompany(){                      <br>
                console.log("in my company");         <br>
            }                                         <br>

        }                                             <br>  
        Drone.getCompany();                           <br>
    </p>
<br>




<h4>Getters and setters</h4>
<p>
    Getters and setters can be used in a class. 
    <br>
    Private properties have an underscore character before the property name. For example <b>this._id = id</b>.
    Getters and seters are used to create properties that look like functions.
